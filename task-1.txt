Lütfen seçtiğiniz algoritmaya ait çözümü ve diğer isterleri aşağıya ekleyiniz:

# Exam Study Plan - Main Version

## Pseudocode 

1. Collect all topics to study
2. For each topic:
    a. Assess difficulty (easy, medium, hard)
    b. Assign priority based on difficulty (hard → high priority)
3. Estimate total available study time
4. Allocate study time per topic according to priority
5. For each topic:
    a. While understanding < 100%:
        i. Review topic
        ii. Take breaks if needed
6. After all topics are covered, do a final comprehensive review
7. End

# Exam Study Plan - Variant A

## Pseudocode

1. Collect all topics to study
2. For each topic:
    a. Identify exam weight (high, medium, low)
    b. Assign priority based on exam weight (high → first)
3. Estimate total available study time
4. Allocate time per topic based on priority
5. For each topic:
    a. While understanding < 100%:
        i. Review topic
        ii. Solve sample questions
6. Final comprehensive review for all topics
7. End


# Exam Study Plan - Variant B

## Pseudocode

1. Collect all topics to study
2. Estimate total available study time
3. Divide time equally among all topics
4. For each topic:
    a. Review topic
    b. If topic is difficult:
        i. Repeat review
5. After all topics, do a final quick review of the weakest topics
6. End



## LLM conversation:
Student: I have a problem and I should find the best algorithm for it. 
I am studying and I need to make a revision plan for my exams week. 
Can you tell me more about this problem and make it clearer for me?

LLM: Sure! Let's break it down. 
Your problem is about planning your study schedule efficiently for exam week. 
The main goals are:
1. Cover all subjects or topics you need to study before the exams.
2. Focus more on topics you find difficult or are more important in the exam.
3. Use your available time effectively, so nothing is left out.
4. Repeat study sessions for weak topics to make sure you fully understand them.

In real-life terms, it's like organizing your day to finish all tasks: 
you decide what to do first, how much time to spend, and what to do if something takes longer than expected. 
Similarly, your study plan algorithm will decide the order of topics, time allocation, and repetitions.

Student: Okay, that makes sense. So how should I start creating the algorithm?

LLM: A good approach is to break it into steps:
1. Collect all topics you need to study.
2. Assess the difficulty or priority of each topic.
3. Estimate your total available study time.
4. Allocate time to each topic according to its priority.
5. For each topic:
   - While understanding < 100%:
       * Review the topic
       * Take breaks if needed
6. After all topics are covered, do a final comprehensive review.

Student: Is there any other ways to solve this problem?

LLM: Yes! You can create multiple versions:
- **Variant A:** Prioritize topics based on their exam weight (high → first, low → last)
- **Variant B:** Divide time equally among all topics, but repeat weak topics more often
- **Variant C:** Focus on your weakest topics first, then cover the easier ones
You can write pseudocode for each version and later compare advantages and disadvantages.

Student: I want you to write all these solutions as pseudocode.
