# I have problem in getting to the bus I live in FETHI SKIN YURDU and we have a special bus for the dorm its from the dorm to uni and from the uni to dorm so every time wither i go early or late i be unable to get on the bus becouse of the severe crowding  and miss my classes ðŸ˜” so here is Algorithem for this problem.


# Bus Catching 
## Main Algorithm

### Pseudocode

1. Input:
   - bus_direction (Left or Right)
   - traffic_delay_range = [0 min, 30 min]  # bus may arrive anytime between 7:00â€“7:30
   - walking_speed (meters/minute)
   - distance_to_bus_stop (meters)

2. Set expected_bus_position:
   - If bus_direction == Left:
       expected_bus_position = midpoint of 0 to 10 meters
       go to the left side
   - Else if bus_direction == Right:
       expected_bus_position = midpoint of 10 to 20 meters
       go to the right side

3. Set optimal_waiting_spot = expected_bus_position

4. Calculate latest_departure_time:
   - time_to_walk = distance_to_bus_stop / walking_speed
   - latest_bus_arrival_time = 7:30  # bus leaves at 7:30
   - departure_time = latest_bus_arrival_time - time_to_walk

5. Output:
   - departure_time (to leave home)
   - optimal_waiting_spot



**Explanation:**  
This algorithm helps you arrive **just in time** at the optimal location to catch the bus, reducing waiting time and maximizing your chance to find a seat, even during severe crowding,
Using this algorithem you will be on the perfect possible soultion ðŸ˜„ . 



## LLM Conversation Summary

Student: I have a problem catching the dorm bus because of crowding. as problem solving and algorithem expert, How can I optimize departure and waiting spot?  

LLM: Goals:  
1. Minimize walking and waiting time  
2. Choose the best position to board the bus  
3. Consider traffic delays and bus arrival window  

Student: How can I implement this as an algorithm?  

LLM:  
- Use inputs: direction, walking speed, distance, and traffic delay  
- Calculate expected bus position based on direction  
- Determine optimal waiting spot  
- Compute latest departure time to reach the bus on time  
- Output both departure time and waiting position  
Student: can you help me writting the possible pseudo code?
