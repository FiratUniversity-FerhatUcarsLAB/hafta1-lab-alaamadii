# I have problem in getting to the bus I live in FETHI SKIN YURDU and we have a special bus for the dorm its from the dorm to uni and from the uni to dorm so every time wither i go early or late i be unable to get on the bus becouse of the severe crowding  and miss my classes 😔 so here is Algorithem for this problem.


# Bus Catching 

1. Input:
   - bus_direction (Left or Right)
   - traffic_delay_range = [0 min, 30 min]  # bus may arrive anytime between 7:00–7:30
   - walking_speed (meters/minute)
   - distance_to_bus_stop (meters)

2. Set expected_bus_position:
   - If bus_direction == Left:
       expected_bus_position = midpoint of 0 to 10 meters
       go to the left side
   - Else if bus_direction == Right:
       expected_bus_position = midpoint of 10 to 20 meters
       go to the right side

3. Set optimal_waiting_spot = expected_bus_position

4. Calculate latest_departure_time:
   - time_to_walk = distance_to_bus_stop / walking_speed
   - latest_bus_arrival_time = 7:30  # bus leaves at 7:30
   - departure_time = latest_bus_arrival_time - time_to_walk

5. Output:
   - departure_time (to leave home)
   - optimal_waiting_spot

Using this algorithem you will be on the perfect possible position to get on the bus and even can find a seat.😏😉
